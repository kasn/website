          <h1>About Refresh</h1>
          <p>
            We're designers and developers, passionate about pixels and code. We embrace
            the rapid development of the web and are open to new ideas, opporunities for
            us to try new things before they become standard. We make things and break
            things because we can. We are inspired by passion, not profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also understand that designers and developers are codependent in today's web.
            Refresh brings together these web workers to bridge the gap between our fields,
            so that we can share and learn from each other to bring the web forward.
          </p>

          <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

              <h3>Who is behind Refresh?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  We are not a company, just people. We volunteer our time and energy to
                  bring you Refresh, because we are looking for the same thing:
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Fall 2011, a small group of designers and developers met at conferences and
                  user groups in Switzerland and Germany. We were looking for other people like us.
                  Colleagues and friends said we needed to look in Berlin. We disagreed.
                  And so Refresh was born.

              <h3>Why "Refesh"?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  We brainstormed several ideas over many weeks, but Refresh stuck the most. When
                  designing and building pages, we hit the refresh button all day. More
                  importantly, we want to refresh the Munich web scene, distrupt it and
                  give it new energy.

              <h3>What do Refresh members do together?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  Right now, we have a regular <em>Stammtisch</em> that's a <em>Gaudi</em>. Over
                  dinner and beers, we discuss upcoming conferences, the newest libraries, app ideas,
                  dribbble favorites, etc. But we also just enjoy each other's company and are just
                  as likely to be discussing the quality of the snow in the Alps, climbing techniques
                  and the best Burgers in Munich.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We're also in the process of organizing our own events, member lectures, etc.
                  for Munich. Follow us on Twitter for the latest updates.

              <h3>Who can join Refresh?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  To ensure the quality of our meetups, Refresh is a closed user group and invite
                  only. But it's pretty easy to join.

                  Meetups and events are organized for fun and exchange, not profit. Even if there
                  are no event fees, we hope you will support local restaurants, bars and cafes that
                  let us reserve tables and offer us W-LAN by ordering food and drinks from them.

                <p>No sponsors also means no ads, pitches, or recruiters - yay!</p>
